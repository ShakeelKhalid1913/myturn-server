Linear Regression (First Try):
    Simplest approach
    Performed very poorly with negative R² scores
    Assumed linear relationships between features and wait times, 
    which wasn't true

Random Forest & XGBoost (Second Try):
    Tried these to handle non-linear relationships
    Had installation issues with XGBoost
    Still didn't perform well

SVR - Support Vector Regression (Third Try):
    More sophisticated approach for non-linear data
    Still performed poorly (R² = 0.03)
    All these models failed because they tried to use unrelated features

LSTM (Current Model):
    Completely different approach treating it as a time series
    Uses sequence of past wait times to predict future
     
    Much better results (RMSE ≈ 7 minutes)
    Works better because restaurant wait times naturally follow 
    patterns over time

The key lesson was that the type of model mattered less than understanding 
the true nature of the problem - 
it's a time series prediction task, not a feature-based regression problem.
